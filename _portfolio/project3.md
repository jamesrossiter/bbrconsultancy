#### Governors with particular reference to strategic planning, medium/long term financial planning and monitoring in the context of a rapidly changing educational environment<br/><br/>

#### Initiating a £330m (“Real Value” project cost) Education & Leisure PFI project
Creating and promoting a vision for education across Bassetlaw (and hence Valley School). This included the preparatory networking, commitment building and (2 phase) bidding support for PFI credits to deliver a full rebuild of Valley School, four other 11-18 schools, a 3-18 Special School and two post-16 Centres. The project includes two additional Leisure Centres for the district (RV ~£60m). To achieve this project I worked with many stakeholders including Governors, LEA/LA officers, elected Members, all nine secondary schools and other primaries in Bassetlaw, parents, community groups, the Local Authority, Education Committee, MPs, the Learning & Skills Council and Development Agencies.
#### PFI Project Board
Member of this and the subsequent PFI Project Partnering Board.
#### Post 16 Working Group
Led the development of the leadership/management and financial structures required in the two unique PFI post-16 Centres. The Worksop post-16 Centre (part of Valley School) delivers primarily AS & A2 courses to Worksop school students and forms part of the “Worksop solution” for co-ordinated delivery of post 16 continuing education.
#### Brokering Academy status
For both Valley and Portland Schools (the only two secondary schools in Worksop town) with a single sponsor to ensure co-ordinated development for Worksop secondary education into the future.
#### Specialist Technology College status
#### Complete remodelling of the whole school workforce on two occasions
In 2005/06 under the Government “Workforce Reform” agenda where cover and invigilation were removed from teachers. In 2011 a full restructuring and reductions in staffing process designed to enable the school to weather the forthcoming tightening of budgets and prepare for Academy status.
